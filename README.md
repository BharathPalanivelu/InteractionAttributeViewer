With this Client AddIn, a new tab is available to be added to the client.  This tab can be used to display standard call attributes in a list.  This can be useful to help inspect call properties.  

To deploy, build the solution and copy the dlls to C:\Program Files (x86)\Interactive Intelligence\ICUserApps\AddIns and start the Interaction Client.
